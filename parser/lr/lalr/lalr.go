// Package lalr provides data structures and algorithms for building Look-Ahead LR (LALR) parsers.
// An LALR parser is a bottom-up parser for the class of LR(1) grammars.
//
// An LALR parser, similar to SLR, uses the canonical LR(0) items to construct the state machine (DFA),
// but refines the states by incorporating lookahead symbols explicitly.
// LALR merges states with identical core LR(0) items but handles lookahead symbols for each merged state separately,
// making it more precise than SLR and avoids many conflicts that SLR might encounter.
// LALR is more powerful than SLR as it can handle a wider range of grammars, including most programming languages.
// However, it is less powerful than canonical LR(1) because state merging
// can lose distinctions in lookahead contexts, potentially leading to conflicts for some grammars.
//
// For more details on parsing theory,
// refer to "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (2nd Edition)".
