// Package grammar implements data structures and algorithms for formal grammars.
//
// In the theory of languages, a formal grammar is a set of rules or productions
// that define the structure of strings within a formal language.
// A formal grammar defines which strings in a formal language's alphabet are syntactically valid.
// It specifies the structure of the strings but does not address their meaning or usage in a given context.
